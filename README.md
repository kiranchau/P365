# Policy 365 - Frontend

## Project Description

Policy 365 is an online policy comparison and purchase platform in the insurance domain. The aim is to provide customers with a comprehensive platform to compare, purchase, and manage insurance policies seamlessly. This React JS application serves as the frontend for Policy 365.

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define and capture the key business requirements for the development and enhancement of NIBPLâ€™s Policies365. This document serves as a vital communication tool between stakeholders, ensuring a clear understanding of the objectives and expectations for the project.

## Objectives

The primary objective is to develop an online policy comparison and purchase platform similar to policybazaar, coverfox, turtlemint, insurancedekho. The goal is to make www.policies365.com a running platform, significantly enhancing the user experience to increase policy selling business and customer retention.

### Existing Business Process:

The company relies heavily on traditional insurance sales agents. The existing process involves customer inquiries, face-to-face or on-call consultations, quote generation and comparison, documentation, premium payment, policy issuance, policy updates, changes, claims process, and renewals.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

## Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes, and you may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed. See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Code Splitting

Policy 365 utilizes code splitting to improve the performance and loading speed of the application. The code splitting feature allows the bundling of code into smaller chunks that are loaded on-demand, reducing the initial load time for users.

## Analyzing the Bundle Size

It's crucial to monitor and optimize the size of the application bundle, especially for production deployments. This project includes tools to analyze the bundle size and identify areas for optimization.

## Making a Progressive Web App (PWA)

Policy 365 is designed as a Progressive Web App (PWA), providing a seamless experience for users across various devices and network conditions. PWAs offer offline capabilities, faster loading times, and enhanced user interactions.
